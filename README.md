# Closest Associates

An association graph and incidence matrix implementation that we implemented in Java, along with a dataset generator in Python. This was made for our Algorithms and Analysis assignment 1.

This was a fun assignment, and the linked list implementation that was required for the association graph helped heavily in the future Advanced Programming Techniques [Qwirkle! assignment](https://github.com/blee1710/QwirklesqueGame).
